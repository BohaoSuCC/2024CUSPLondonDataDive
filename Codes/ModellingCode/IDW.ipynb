    "If you want to generate a raster image instead of a scatter plot, you can modify the visualization part of the code to use imshow instead of contourf and scatter. This change will display the interpolated values as a raster image, which represents the data on a regular grid in image format. Here's how you can adapt the previous example for a raster visualization, including translated comments and descriptions in English:"
