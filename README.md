**Research Question**: How to predict High-precision, street-level air quality without having monitors on each road?

**Data Source**:

1.[London Air Quality(real-time)](https://api.erg.ic.ac.uk/AirQuality/help)

2.[London Congestion Scoot](https://roads.data.tfl.gov.uk/)

3.[Weather Data](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api)


**Abstract**: 

In London, there are only 100 air quality monitoring stations, which are not enough to cover the whole city to render a high-precision street-level air quality heatmap. We aim to predict the air quality of the whole city by using the data from the monitoring stations, the traffic data, and the weather data. Spatio-temporal analysis and deep learning models are utilized to predict the air quality of the whole city. The following comparison between GIFs could show how the prediction model could help decision-makers or public to understand the air quality of the specific ward/community even for whole city.
